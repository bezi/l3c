        Nothing but America's three best friends (and most eligible bachelors)
        realizing how very photogenic we are and sharing that gift with the
        world.
      </li>
      <li class="q">Why does Adam have a moustache?</li>
      <li class="a">
        He told enough dad jokes that one night it just mysteriously appeared.

      <li class="q">Is Oscar ok?</li>
      <li class="a">
        Mom, I swear, I'm fine. No, it's not a phase. No, I cannot get rid of
        the tattoos, that's what makes them tattoos.

      <li class="q">Is L3C hiring?</li>
      <li class="a">
        We are actively looking for a human resources manager, since we can
        never amicably agree on where to get dinner. Experience in couple's
        therapy is a plus. Please send a CV and references to
        <a href="mailto:careers@l3c.us">careers@l3c.us</a>.
      </li>
      <li class="q">
        I'm having issues with the Cisco SG350 interfacing with Cisco IE2000
        switches. Do you have any advice on working with industrial network
        switches?
      </li>

      <li class="a">
        Generally we've found that SFP Compatibility between Cisco Small
        Business switches (such as the SG350) and the Cisco Industrial Switches
        (like the IE2000) is poorly defined and can be finicky. For best
        results, stick to one class of switches or the other. Anecdotally, we've
        been happy with a combined fleet of IE2000s and IE4000s.
