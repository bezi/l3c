          Once again, it was Oscar.  This time, it was because he re-read Amal
          El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone's beautiful, poignant short novel <a
              href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43352954-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war">This
              is How You Lose the Time War</a> and spent a week sobbing on the
          couch.

      <li class="q">
        So is Oscar going to die in a horrific cave diving incident? (part 2)
      </li>
      <li class="a">
          Those of you familiar with last year's FAQ may recall Oscar's
          insistence that he would never cave dive. This aged like milk.
          Consider this our formal retraction.

      <li class="q">
          Does L3C have any career opportunities currently available?

      <li class="a">
          Oscar keeps asking this as well, and no, we will not pay him to sit
          around drinking margaritas and "talking about dive stuff".

        The daisy chain RS-485 network for my industrial controls isn't cutting
        it any more. I want more data throughput but can't replace my two wire
        cable! Help!

        Boy howdy, what an unfortunate situation. Not to worry, we've got a
        solution to suggest. Upgrade to the modern world of Ethernet! Over my
        existing two wire cable? You bet! The IEEE 802.3cg standard establishes
        10BASE-T1L as a physical layer solution to provide 10Mbps capacity at up
        to 1km distances over two wire cable! The insertion and return loss of
        your cable will impact your maximum distance so don't expect 1km over
        crappy 28AWG non-twisted pair cable but if you do your homework, T1L can
        be a fantastic way to utilize existing cabling to move from limited
        RS-485 solutions to the modern world of Ethernet at incredible
        distances. Not to mention, being standards compliant means you're more
        likely to be able to plug and play with other 10BASE-T1L standards
        compliant devices! T1L PHYs and MAC/PHYs exist from multiple
        semiconductor providers, but we would suggest the ADIN1100, ADIN1110,
        and ADIN2111 from Analog Devices (we're not biased at all).
