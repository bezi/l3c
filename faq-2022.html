            So why are these so late??
         </li>
         <li class="a">
            At the beginning of December, Oscar discovered TikTok, and was not seen or heard from for three weeks while he learned how to dance like the youth. Sorry folks! Bet. No cap.

         <li class="q">
            Has hell frozen over? How did Adam take a job that doesn’t involve flying constantly?
         </li>
         <li class="a">Our lawyers have advised us not to comment on any ongoing litigation concerning allegations that Oscar blackmailed Adam into being in Boston more. L3C takes these allegations seriously and is conducting a thorough investigation.

         <li class="q">
            Have y’all given up on LDI at Vegas yet? How can your livers keep up?         
         </li>
         <li class="a">As the years continue, we’ve started replacing drinking with Korean BBQ and hope that this will create a sustainable Vegas future for us as we approach our thirties.
         </li>
         <li class="q">So, have any of y’all gotten girlfriends yet?   </li>
         <li class="a">Regrettably no. We’re still America’s three most eligible bachelors! We’re not sure if this card helps or hurts our cause, let us know in the comments section (engagement!). Pedro and Oscar will be going on a Valentine’s Day cruise together, and hope to meet their life partners at the buffet shrimp station. Adam will be at a wedding (not his).
         </li>
         <li class="q">So is Oscar going to die in a horrific cave diving incident?    </li>
         <li class="a">Luckily, despite things going really well for him, he doesn’t make “technical cave diver” money… yet.
         </li>
         <li class="q">Is L3C still hiring given the current state of the technology sector?         </li>
         <li class="a">We have recently decided the company should enter the social media industry and disrupt it by actually being profitable. If you have relevant work experience and want to help us build Twitter 2: Electric Boogaloo (trademark pending), please send a CV and references to <a href="mailto:careers@l3c.us">careers@l3c.us</a>. Experience in handling short-tempered genius CEOs is a huge plus.

         <li class="q">What is LC3’s official stance on The Try Guys situation?        </li>
         <li class="a">Oscar has made a personal statement against advice of counsel asking “What do you mean I’m the Ned? Who is Ned?” and “Now that there’s only three of them I could absolutely &lt;redacted&gt; those &lt;unintelligble&gt;.” This statement is Oscar’s alone and does not reflect L3C’s official position on the events at hand.

         <li class="q">Should I chase airline status? What airline? How do I get free first class, plz?        </li>
         <li class="a">
            Chasing airline status is a game, a silly game. Do yourself a favor and find a different hobby. For those of you who are still here, insisting on churning for status please see the instructional below:
            <ol>
               <li>Pick an airline whose hub is near you and flies where you need to go. Then find someone else to pay for the majority of your travel.

         <li class="q">
            What lighting controller should I use for my large, permanent, outdoor, architectural lighting installation on a bridge?
         </li>
         <li class="a">Our highest recommendation goes to the Pharos architectural controllers. Though we can’t comment on the newest “Expert” controllers, we highly recommend the Pharos LPC X with DVI input card as it has been incredibly flexible and served us well with both startup configuration activities and show content creation flexibility. Though pricey and without a native web-based calendar scheduling tool, its multitude of other strengths far outweigh the scheduling disadvantage (which could be overcome with some clever scripting and a custom web interface).

         <li class="q">Yinz are sure yinz aren’t a throuple?
         </li>
         <li class="a">Yes, we’re sure. We’re just three lads making banging Christmas Cards. But what happens in Vegas at the Circus Circus wedding chapel stays in Vegas.
         </li>
         <li class="q">Does L3C support any political or lobbying efforts?
         </li>
         <li class="a">As we are under audit, we cannot disclose our political contributions. However Oscar and Pedro are proud, card-carrying members of the AARP and use their discounts at Jamba Juice with joy.
